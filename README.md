# Beer-API-Project
-------------------

This is a website showcasing the various alcoholic drinks based on Punk API (https://punkapi.com). This project was aimed to strengthen my knowledge of React. 

# Features
-------------------------------
The website allows you to:

- Search through the list of drinks by name

- Filter the content on three conditions: 
• High Alcohol (ABV value greater than 6%) 
• Classic Range (Was first brewed before 2010) 
• High Acidity (pH lower than 4) 
 
 - Look at the about section which provides food pairing recommendations, and some brewing tips.
